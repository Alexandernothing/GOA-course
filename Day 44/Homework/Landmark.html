    <p>The island has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy">solar powered</a> lighthouse located at the entrance of the Mossuril Bay, it is used as a guide for the offshore vessels en route to Island of Mozambique and is still in service, run by the lighthouse keeper and his family that lived in Goa, India for more than two decades. It is one of the oldest and popular lighthouses in Mozambique, built during the Portuguese Mozambique era in 1876 and is an oldest example of the robust square tower design of lighthouses in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar">Zanzibar</a> and the coast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa">German East Africa</a> (now Tanzania).

        During the 20th-century in 1923 the station was upgraded with new lanterns and lenses with the tower being raised from its original height of 12 m (39 ft) to 31 m (102 ft). It is accessible by the public, one can witness the panoramic view from the top of the lighthouse which is next to the island's beach.</p>
