                How much does a Gold’s Gym day pass cost?
                Many Gold’s Gyms offer free day passes to let you try before you buy. For instance, the East Northport location in New York gives new visitors one day free. Conditions include being a local resident, at least 18 years old (unless signed in by a parent or guardian) and having a valid ID. <br>
                
                To get a free pass, you can fill out the form on the Gold’s Gym website. <br>
                
                How does Gold’s Gym fit into your budget?
                A gym membership can feel like both a want and a need. On one hand, staying healthy is a need so we can live a long content life. But a luxury gym membership with all the bells and whistles may move that need into more of a want. <br>
                
                Try looking at your budget through the 50/30/20 framework to see where a gym membership fits for you. With this budgeting method, you allocate 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants and 20% to savings and debt repayment beyond minimums. <br>
                
                As you review your wants versus needs, it may be helpful to think about other ways to save money to make room in your budget for a gym membership. For instance, can you switch from name-brand products to generic to save a couple of bucks? Or could you cut back on coffee shop orders and dining out? <br>
                
                Then, do your research. Check the amenities each membership tier offers and decide what you can live without. And don’t forget to take advantage of promotions like free trial passes.</p>
