    <hr>
    <p><b>  Association football</b>, more commonly known as <b>football</b> or <b>soccer</b>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport">team sport</a> played between two teams of 11 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_player">players</a> each, who primarily use their feet to propel a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)">ball</a> around a rectangular field called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch">pitch</a>. The objective of the game is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_in_association_football">score</a> more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sports)">goal</a> defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</p>
