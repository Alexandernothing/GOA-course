    <hr>
    <p id="p1">Association football is a type of football that has its roots in ancient ball games. In the English-speaking world, it is commonly called "football" in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but "soccer" is used in places where other football codes are popular, like Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. In New Zealand, "football" is becoming more common despite the popularity of rugby.
<br>
        The term "soccer" comes from Oxford slang from the late 19th century, where it was derived from "association" football. It was originally spelled "assoccer" and later shortened to "soccer." The term was first recorded in 1889 and has since become widely used in various regions</p>
