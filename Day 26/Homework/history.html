        <p id="p">Kicking ball games have appeared independently in many cultures. The ancient Chinese game cuju, from the Han dynasty, involved passing a ball and kicking it through a goal on poles. Other East Asian games influenced by cuju include Japan's kemari and Korea's chuk-guk. In North America, the Algonquian game pasuckuakohowog was similar to contemporary European folk football.

            In ancient Greece, games like phaininda, episkyros, and the Roman harpastum involved ball handling and violence, resembling rugby and volleyball more than modern football. Despite these historical games, FIFA states that association football has no direct historical link to ancient ball games outside Europe.

            The modern rules of association football originated from efforts in 19th-century England to standardize various football forms. The Cambridge Rules of 1848 influenced the development of association football. In 1863, The Football Association established the first comprehensive rules, which led to the formation of modern football.

            The FA Cup, the worldâ€™s oldest football competition, started in 1872. The first international match also occurred that year. The world's first football league began in 1888. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), formed in 1886, sets the Laws of the Game. FIFA, founded in 1904, adheres to these laws and joined IFAB in 1913.

            While Europe and South America dominated football in the 20th century, other regions have improved significantly in the 21st century. European clubs remain dominant, and no team from outside Europe or South America has won the FIFA World Cup. The U.S. women's national team is a notable exception in women's football.

            Football is played globally at both professional and amateur levels, with millions watching and participating in the sport. It evokes deep passion and can influence social and political events, such as truces or conflicts</p>
